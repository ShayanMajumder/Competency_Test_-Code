# Matrix transformations 
Develope a class for affine transformation which should take an affine matrix(3x3) as a parameter. Using this class object we must be able to transform cartesian_representation vector. You can use any boost library if required. (Plus points if all representations can be transformed)
This is a simple test code for changing in coordinate frames using C++.
